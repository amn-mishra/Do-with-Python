There are several reasons ,Some common causes include:
 Extreme temperature changes, which can cause the glass to expand and contract, 
 eventually leading to cracking or breaking.
 Mechanical stress, such as a heavy object striking the glass, could cause it to break.
 Factory defects, such as a weak spot in the glass, could cause it to break.

Manual Analysis:
In the CCTV image, it would be difficult to determine the exact cause of the back window glass breaking without further information or a closer look at the footage.
However, a manual analysis could involve looking at the position and orientation of the car, surrounding objects, and any potential sources of impact such as nearby
construction or other vehicles.

Proposed Solution using AI/ML:
One possible solution to identify the object, point of impact , and angle of impact could be to use computer vision algorithms and machine learning models. This could
involve training a model on a large dataset of images and video clips to detect objects and identify the source of impact. The model could then be applied to the CCTV
image to determine the likely cause of the glass breaking.
In terms of feasibility , using AI / ML for this task is possible, but would require a substantial amount of training data and computational resources . Additionally ,
accurately identifying the object, point of impact, and angle of impact from a single CCTV image can be challenging and may require additional data or a more 
sophisticated model.
